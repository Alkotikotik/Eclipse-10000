module ALULANE (
    //Well well finally starting the GPU im so excited for it.
    //So first one is ofc ALULANE its the basic GPU contruct.
    //The heart is efp32 FMA that is done through 2DSPs, it also has integer mode,
    //16bit fma, float to int conversion and min/max/abs.
    input logic [31:0] a, b, c;

    output logic [31:0] result
);

    //So efp32 is Eclipsing Floating (Point/Precision word-play) 32bits
    //Its a custom floating format I designed, I actually spent a little while
    //invinting it from scratch, and I came up to a conclusion that main idea
    //behind float32 is undeniebely the best.
    //The implementation isn't the best tho thus I changed it.
    //First - one bit from exponent moved to mantissa. That halfs floating
    //point error by two, and exact integer is up to 33m. I did it bc I feel
    //like its more useful for 3d graphics, and also exp+sign bits into 1byte
    //and mantissa into 3bytes, and I think its pretty neat.
    //Second - it is 100% efficient now, no repeating patterns and massive
    //number of NaNs and stuff.
    //Third - + and - inf and 1 pattern for undef, also undef = undef.
    //1/0 is always undef dw.
    //It also implement subnormals. And bias exponent just 1 less bit.
